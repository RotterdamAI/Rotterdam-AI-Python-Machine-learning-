    "Welcome to your first programming exercise. Before we start of with diving into the code I want to give a short explaination about how we can use a notebook (The type of editor we are currently using to write our python code). Each block of code is called a cell if you want to run a cell you press `shift + enter`. If you by accident made an infinite loop or crashed your editor, restart your kernel this way all running code will be shut down and everything stored in memory will reset."

Then there is the cell with the hint code, if you need help with the exercise because its not clear what to do or if you need an extra suggestion run the hint cell. At last we have the test cell, if you want to test if your solution is the correct one run this cell and it will tell you if you passed the exercise or not."
